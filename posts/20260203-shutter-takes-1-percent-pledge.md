Protocol Guild is honored to welcome Shutter as the newest project to commit to the 1% Pledge --- a growing norm that routes a portion of ecosystem value directly to the people responsible for scaling, securing, and maintaining Ethereum. Through this commitment, Shutter is signaling long-term alignment with Ethereum's core contributors and the public infrastructure that underpins the protocol.

Shutter is an encryption-as-a-service protocol that makes simultaneous-move situations fair by ensuring no participant can see another's move before making their own. The protocol is working to implement encrypted mempools on Ethereum mainnet --- a critical step toward preventing malicious MEV and real-time censorship. These efforts directly reinforce Ethereum's neutrality and credible execution guarantees.

Beyond encrypted mempools, Shutter is powering a growing range of applications, including private voting, sealed-bid auctions, pari-mutuel betting, and sealed bounties. These primitives enable new forms of coordination and market design that depend on fairness, privacy, and resistance to manipulation --- values closely aligned with Ethereum's core design philosophy.

Shutter's participation in the 1% Pledge reflects a shared belief that privacy and censorship resistance are not optional features, but rather essential public goods. By committing part of the value created by the Shutter ecosystem back to Ethereum's maintainers, the pledge helps underwrite the long-term reliability of the base layer these applications depend on. This creates a positive feedback loop: stronger core infrastructure enables more advanced applications, which in turn help sustain the protocol itself.

#### About Shutter

Shutter is an encryption-as-a-service protocol that makes simultaneous-move situations fair by ensuring no participant can see another's move before making their own. Shutter is working to implement encrypted mempools on Ethereum mainnet --- which will prevent malicious MEV and real-time censorship. Shutter is also powering a range of applications including private voting, sealed-bid auctions, pari-mutuel betting, and sealed bounties.

Shutter is supported by Shutter DAO 0x36, a decentralized onchain organization that funds ecosystem projects and elects the Keypers --- the decentralized group that generates and safeguards the cryptographic keys enabling Shutter's encrypted mempools, shielded voting, and API.

#### About Protocol Guild

Protocol Guild is a peer-managed collective of Ethereum protocol contributors and the leading independent organization dedicated to sustainable funding for core development. Since 2022, Protocol Guild has distributed nearly $36MM directly to the individuals stewarding Ethereum protocol upgrades and maintenance.

Funding streams from the 1% Pledge vest over four years and are distributed to Protocol Guild's 184 current members according to transparent weighting and membership processes.
